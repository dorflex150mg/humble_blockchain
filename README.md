# humble_blockchain

## Project Overview

This project implements a simple blockchain environment in Rust. It includes core components like mining, wallet management, transaction processing, and blockchain management. The `test_core` module demonstrates the creation of a blockchain, the mining of blocks by multiple miners, and the handling of transactions between wallets.

## Features

- **Blockchain Creation**: A blockchain is initialized with a genesis block.
- **Mining**: Blocks are mined with or without transactions, adjusting the blockchain length and difficulty dynamically.
- **Wallets**: Each miner has an associated wallet with coins that can be transferred between users.
- **Transactions**: Transactions are signed by wallets and included in the mining process.
- **Concurrency**: Multiple miners can mine simultaneously using threads, with access to a shared blockchain through synchronization mechanisms.

## Structure

The code in the project is broken down into the following main components:

1. **Chain**: Manages the blockchain itself, including adding blocks and managing blockchain metadata.
2. **Miner**: Represents a miner that participates in the mining process, handles wallet interactions, and mines new blocks.
3. **Wallet**: Represents a user's wallet, allowing users to hold coins and sign transactions.
4. **Transaction**: Represents a transaction between two wallets that can be included in a block.

## Gossip Protocol Test (Test Gossip)

This module simulates a simple gossip protocol between multiple nodes in a network using asynchronous communication. It demonstrates how transactions propagate through nodes using a tracker, regular nodes, and a miner node.

#### Features:

- **Node Types**:
  - **Tracker Node**: A central node that tracks other nodes in the network and relays information.
  - **Regular Node**: A node that joins the network and communicates with the tracker.
  - **Miner Node**: A specialized node that mines blocks and handles transactions.
  
- **Mock Transaction Creation**: 
  The `make_up_transaction` function generates dummy transactions between two wallets using a placeholder token for testing purposes.

- **Transaction Propagation**:
  - The `send_transaction_loop` function simulates sending transactions repeatedly from one node to another via channels, either for a fixed number of iterations or indefinitely.
  
- **Gossip Network Simulation**:
  The `test_gossip` function creates and runs a gossip network with the following setup:
  
  1. **Tracker Node**: Created at `127.0.0.1:8081` and acts as the initial node.
  2. **Regular Node**: Created at `127.0.0.1:8082`, connected to the tracker node.
  3. **Miner Node**: Created at `127.0.0.1:8083`, connected to the tracker node.

The network starts up asynchronously, with each node running its own event loop. Transactions are generated by the tracker node and sent through the network, mimicking the flow of information in a gossip protocol.

## Usage
